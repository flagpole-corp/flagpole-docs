## Getting Started

1. Create your first feature flag
2. Install the SDK for your platform
3. Integrate feature flags into your application
4. Control feature rollouts from the dashboard

## Platform Components

- **Admin Dashboard**: Web interface for managing feature flags and rollouts
- **Client SDKs**: Libraries for React (_more coming_)
- **Server SDKs**: Backend integration with Node.js (_wip_)
- **REST API**: Direct API access for custom integrations (_wip_)

## Core Concepts

- **Feature Flags**: Toggle points in your code that control feature visibility
- **Targeting Rules**: Conditions that determine who sees which features
- **Organizations**: Top-level grouping for managing teams and projects
- **Projects**: Logical groupings of related feature flags
- **Environments**: Separate contexts for development, staging, and production
